        </ul>

        <h3>Exclusive Remedy</h3>
        <p>
          By submitting a takedown request, you acknowledge that the removal of
          your content constitutes the primary remedy for any claims regarding
          the material. You agree not to pursue any additional legal action
          against the Service operator (Alok Das) regarding the removed content.
        </p>

        <h3>No Liability for Past Hosting</h3>
        <p>
          The operator assumes no liability for any period during which your
          content was hosted prior to submission of the takedown request. The
          Service acts as a neutral host and does not actively verify copyright
          status of uploaded content.
        </p>

        <h3>False Claims</h3>
        <p>
          Submitting a takedown request with knowingly false information may
          result in legal consequences. Please ensure all information provided
          is accurate.
        </p>
